    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is not a copycat; it's the genuine article!  Chipotle revealed its guac recipe several years ago, so you can make the real thing at home!</p>
    <p>It's just as delicious as you remember and fairly simple to make, but a food processor speeds things up significantly, if you're in a rush.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe Hass avocados</li>
        <li>2 tsp lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cilantro (chopped)</li>
        <li>¼ cup red onion (diced)</li>
        <li>½ jalapeño, including seeds (diced)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the avocados in half and remove pits carefully.</li>
        <li>Scoop the avocados into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Toss and coat with lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and mash until a smooth consistency is achieved.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pro tip: To achieve that extra-smooth consistency with a few delightful chunks, use a large metal whisk, instead of a fork or spoon, to help break up the avocado halves.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fold in the remaining ingredients and mix.</li>
        <li>Taste the guac and adjust seasoning, if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
